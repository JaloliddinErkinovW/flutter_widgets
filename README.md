# flutter_widgets
I have created 2 dart files. 1st one, 'main.dart' files is used to run the application and all other things (widgets) are in 2nd, 'widgets.dart' file.

We have 4 widgets:
  Greetings widget prints out the text given as a parameter on the application.

  Counter widget makes a button which increments the number of counts (which is also printed out on the application with calling the widget).

  Root, Header and Counter widgets are connected as a tree with 3 levels. Whenever Root widget is called, it calls header and counter widgets also.
