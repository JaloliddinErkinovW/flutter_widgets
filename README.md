# WidgetsPractice

There are two dart files, 'main.dart' which is responsible for running the app and 'widgets.dart' which contains all the widgets.

Brief information about 3 widgets:
  Greeting widget prints out the text which is given as a parametes on the application page.

  Counter widget makes a button which increments the number of counts (text which is printed out with the button while calling the widget) by each click.

  Root widget makes a tree (level 3) of widgets (root widget, header widget and counter widget). Whenever the widget is called, it calls other 2 widgets (header and counter widgets).
